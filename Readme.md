## Problems
### [TWO SUMS](https://bit.ly/3fohKSm)
Given an array of Integers and a target. We need to return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
#### Approach :
Use a Dictionary / Hashmap where you can store the indices of numbers seen so far.
If target - current number is in the dictionary, return the indices.
Else add the index of the current number of the array.
```python
class Solution:
  def twoSum(self, nums:List[int]):
    Yoyo 
    
```
